## Description
>We are making an app that allows garage/basement bands to connect with local concert lovers. The app will allow people to
find local shows as well as their location, price, and ticket medium. It will also allow for bands to post for free and 
market their local shows how they would like to. Many smaller shows are only discovered through word-of-mouth or social media.
Our goal is to make it easier to find small shows. 

## App Functions
