##Description
We are making an app that allows garage/basement bands to connect with local concert lovers. The app will allow people to
find local shows as well as their location, price, and ticket medium. It will also allow for bands to post for free and 
market their local shows how they would like to. Many smaller shows are only discovered through word-of-mouth or social media.
Our goal is to make it easier to find small shows. 

##App Functions
1. Audience
	1. Create/Modify Customer Profile - preferred genres, location, profile picture and description
	2. View a feed with local shows/ search for local shows - posts from local bands with images, ticket prices & medium, location time and date.
	3. If the ticket is through an online vendor - link to the external ticketing site.
	4. Save and bookmark shows with an "interested" button
	5. Follow bands for future announcements
